libnotify.vim
=============

libnotify.vim is a simple wrapper for libnotify, to send notifications from
within Vim.

Documentation
-------------

Please see doc/libnotify.txt for more help, or use 

    :help libnotify

from within Vim once helptags are generated.

Installation
------------

Just copy the contents of this repository into your .vim directory. For a
cleaner separation and keeping track of plugins, I really like
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and git submodules.
